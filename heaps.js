// HEAPS NOTES:
// - Heaps are a catagory of trees
    // - All rules that apply to trees apply to heaps
// - Binary Heaps
    // - Similar to a binary search tree
    // - Max two child nodes (binary)
    // - Common Use Cases
        // - Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues
        // - Binary Heaps are used with graph traversal algos
// - Max Binary Heap: All children are smaller than a parent
    // - Parent nodes are always great than it's children
    // - No gaurentees between children (no implied ordering between siblings)
    // - As compact as possible (talks up the least amount of space)
        // - Both possible nodes are filled before going to the next child
// - Min Binary Heap: All children are larger than a parent
    // - Parent nodes are always smaller than it's children
    // - No gaurentees between children (no implied ordering between siblings)
